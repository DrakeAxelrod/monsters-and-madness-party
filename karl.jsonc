      "Meet Dustin Somnaire, a lad with an unremarkable face but an undeniable and unusual aura. At a cursory glance, he may blend with the crowd, but the moment one brushes past his shoulder, an inexplicable chill runs down their spine - an involuntary shudder of stepping into a dream...or nightmare.",
  
      "Dustin is the last descendant of The Dreamer, the one who accidentally unleashed the Catalyst, blurring the borders of reality and nightmares. With a lineage like that, you'd expect him to have some knack for manipulating dreams. And you'd be right.",
  
      "However, unlike his ambitious ancestor, Dustin just wants to lead an average life. Unfortunately, fate doesn't seem to agree. The dreams he touches seep into reality, spawning anomalies that make life...complicated. A casual daydream about pirate adventures might bring ghostly buccaneers to his coastal town, while a nightmare about a sea monster might result in a suspicious number of unexplained missing swimmers. Talk about an inconvenient power.",
  
      "Even with his reluctant involvement in the magical and supernatural, Dustinâ€™s nature is akin to a lamb lost among wolves. Being a quiet, contemplative individual, he finds solace in ancient texts, often losing himself in the pages of forgotten lore and the world's deepest secrets. And yet, he has the unenviable ability to draw out the fantastical, no matter how hard he tries to avoid it.",
  
      "Just like the world of Monsters&Madness, Dustin's life is a chaotic mix of the ordinary and the extraordinary, constantly teetering on the edge of reality and nightmares."
